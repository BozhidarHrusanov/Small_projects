	a game by Veselin Ruslanov Slavchev


	I have used C++ and the Allegro 4.2.3 game programming library




	You play as the Bubble Rebel and your goal is to collect more
little bubbles than the powerful Evil Bubble. The uneven battle takes
place in the bathroom.

	You are just a bubble, so touching the floor or the ceiling will
make you pop! Be careful, because the Evil Bubble has sharp teeth and
his touch is deadly.
	
	The mechanics of the game revolve around gravity and overcoming it.
When you hold down the space bar the Bubble Rebel holds his breath and
becomes lighter. Don't hold it for too long, though, the Bubble Rebel has
to breathe from time to time - watch your breath meter on the left!

	There is acceleration, friction with the air and bouncing off
walls. Using the left and right arrow keys you can move left and right.

- all of the sounds and music were made by me;
