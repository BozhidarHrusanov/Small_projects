
Thank you for playing Yani: Rise to Power!

Game made in C++ and Allegro 4.3.2 by Veselin Slavchev.
Intro music composed and created by ^^@[®]70o0o2.
Special thanks to Icaka and Tedo.



The game was made as a Philosophy project.
It intends to show that every culture has its strengths
and should be valued. The world would be a better place
without all the religious, ethnical, cultural or any
kind of discrimination.
